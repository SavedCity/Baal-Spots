# Andy Checo's Take Home Project

### Thank you _Baal & Spots_ for allowing me to take some time and design this mockup.

#### _A few pointers on what I did:_

- Mobile first approach

- Made Hamburger menu functional (it was too tempting). There is aso a little extra (when there's an error in the api or when the data is loading).

- Used `emotion-flex-grid` for element containers. Didn't mess with customizing the values of spacing or breakpoint so I gave some of those containers my own lines of code.

- Didn't realize some specific images on figma were available (e.g. credit card chip, union of stars, arrow under header title) so I made those myself from scratch. Updated it when I realized it but not for some since it looked fine.

- Only 1 responsive breakpoint `(1100px)`. Designed at `390px` for mobile then at `1440px`.
